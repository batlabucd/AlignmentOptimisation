# AlignmentOptimisation

'gblocksrun.pl' should be placed in dircetory which includes Pal2Nal (Suyama et al., 2006) and Gblocks (Castresana, 2000), in addition to all sequence alignment files. 

Alignment files are assumed to be protein, of the form [something].prot.prank.aln, where [something] is also the name of the original fasta file containing nucleotide sequences.
